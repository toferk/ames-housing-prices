# Predicting Sale Prices for Homes in Ames, IA
## Multiple Linear Regression Model

### Problem Statement

Given the Ames Housing Dataset, this project aims to create a linear regression model that will predict the sale price of a home. Data was collected from 2051 houses sold in Ames, IA between the years 2006 and 2010, with 82 descriptive features. The goal is to create a predictive model better than a baseline estimate by employing feature engineering, various regularization methods, and cross-validation techniques. 

### Executive Summary

After cross-validation, we determine the lasso method of linear regression modeling gives us the highest, most consistent R^2 score. Our final model considers 201 of our selected features to be strong predictors and accounts for 92% of variability in our target variable, Sale Price. This model can be used to predict the approximate sale price for homes sold in Ames, IA, with certain limitations.
